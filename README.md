###WEEK03 Weekly Task 03
Write a program (secondstring.py) that asks a user to input a string and outputs every second character in reverse order

Goal of this task was to practice using python interpreter built in functions and types, specifically to read in a string use a method to reverse the string and an additional method to then output everysecond letter in the reversed sentence. I did not strip the spaces from the string as this was not specified in the instructions.
